### Frontend

*   **Astro 5:** A modern web framework for building fast, content-rich websites. It uses an "islands architecture" to reduce JavaScript, leading to better performance, while allowing the use of components from various libraries like React.
*   **React 19:** A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It enables the creation of complex, stateful applications with a component-based architecture, making UI development modular and efficient.
*   **TypeScript 5:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity. 
*   **Tailwind CSS 4:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
*   **Shadcn/ui:** A collection of beautifully designed, accessible UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

### Backend and Database

*   **Supabase:** An open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform built on PostgreSQL. It provides a complete backend solution out of the box, including a database, user authentication, instant APIs, storage, and real-time capabilities, significantly speeding up development.

### Testing

*   **Vitest:** A blazing-fast unit testing framework powered by Vite with native TypeScript support. Used for testing services, schemas, hooks, and utility functions with excellent developer experience and fast execution times.
*   **@testing-library/react:** A lightweight testing library for React components that encourages best practices by testing components from the user's perspective rather than implementation details.
*   **Playwright:** A modern end-to-end testing framework that enables reliable cross-browser testing. Used to validate complete user flows from UI interactions through to database operations.
*   **MSW (Mock Service Worker):** An API mocking library that intercepts requests at the network level, allowing for realistic API testing without hitting actual endpoints during frontend tests.
*   **axe-core:** An accessibility testing engine integrated into the test suite to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and catch accessibility issues early in development.
*   **Vitest Coverage (c8):** Code coverage reporting tool that provides detailed insights into test coverage across the codebase.

### CI/CD and Hosting

*   **GitHub Actions:** An automation platform integrated into GitHub that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your repository.
*   **DigitalOcean:** A cloud hosting provider known for its developer-friendly platform (e.g. via docker)
